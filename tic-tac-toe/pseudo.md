# How would I set up the different elements of the game?

# Game loop
# Ask player 1 for their input. A1 - C3.
# Check if cell is empty.
# If not, ask for different input.
# If true, store input in cell.
# Check for victory.
# Display the board.
# No victory? Ask player 2 for their input.
# Victory? Congratulate player, ask if they want to player another game. Clear board.

# Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦ 
# What should be a class? Instance variable? Method?

# Check for victory after every turn.

# What should be a class? Each player? The board? Each cell?

# make new board with nine empty cells with empty value, but predetermined spots?

# how to check if user input is valid? fucking regex?
# if predetermined spots, check if user input matches with any of the spots?
# matches none? invalid input
# matches filled one?
